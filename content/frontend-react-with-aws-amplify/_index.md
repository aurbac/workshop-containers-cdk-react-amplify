[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) consists of a set of tools (open source framework, admin UI, console) and services (static web hosting) to accelerate the development of mobile and web applications on AWS.

[Amplify's open source framework](https://docs.amplify.aws) includes an opinionated set of libraries, UI components, and a command line interface (CLI) to build an app backend and integrate it with your iOS, Android, Web, and React Native apps. The framework leverages a core set of AWS Cloud Services to offer capabilities including offline data, authentication, analytics, push notifications, and bots at high scale.
