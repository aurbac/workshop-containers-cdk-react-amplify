# Workshop - Deploying Containers with AWS CDK v2 and React with AWS Amplify

Hello, this is a self-paced workshop to create a React application hosted on Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. It shows a list of messages stored on an Amazon DynamoDB table. The messages are retrieved using a simple API based on Node.js within a Docker using Amazon Container Service. By the way, that container has continuous deployment enabled by using AWS CodePipeline.

See the diagram below for a depiction of the complete architecture.
